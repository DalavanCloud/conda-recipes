# Conda recipe for building the latest release

You need to add a channel that has conda packages for bison and flex.
For example:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge 
```

Now you can build the conda package for your platform:

```
cd .. && conda build coda
```

And install it from your local package cache:

```
conda install --use-local coda
```
