# Conda recipe for building the latest release

The HARP conda package depends on the CODA conda package,
which is available via the stcorp channel:

```
conda add --channels stcorp
```

You can now build the conda package for your platform:

```
cd .. && conda build harp
```

And install it from your local package cache:

```
conda install --use-local harp
```
